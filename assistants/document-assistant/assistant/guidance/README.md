# Assistant Guidance

This directory contains code for implementing assistant guidance.
Guidance in this context refers to making the experience easier for new users (part of the cold start problem with new assistants/users),
and helping users throughout their experience with the assistant.

One core piece of this is dynamic UI component generation so that users can click components
in an inspector tab rather than typing all of their preferences and relying on the assistant to always ask for preferences.

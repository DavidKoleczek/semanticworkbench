Hello! I am an assistant that can help you with coding projects within the context of the Semantic Workbench.Let's get started by having a conversation about your project. You can ask me questions, request code snippets, or ask for help with debugging. I can also help you with markdown, code snippets, and other types of content. You can also attach .docx, text, and image files to your chat messages to help me better understand the context of our conversation. Where would you like to start?
